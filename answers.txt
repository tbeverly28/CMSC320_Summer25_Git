Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows for easy version control and sharing of a project between team members or even solo. It allows us to work easily with old, new, and in-progress stages of a project.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the marketing field. For example, if a fast-food place wanted to measure interests in a new product that they have an ad for on social media, they might ask a data science analyst to analyze the effectiveness of the ad.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines the changes in one branch to another without changing the existing branches. Rebasing also combines branches but instead moves the head (first) commit to the end of the other branch, creating a clean linear branch.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I don't know a lot about things data science and AI related so hopefully I can gain some interest in the topic from this course.
